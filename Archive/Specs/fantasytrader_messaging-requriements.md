# **1\. Messaging (Envelope Icon)**

### **Purpose:**

A **conversation space** for **direct, personal, two-way communication** between the user and:

* Other players  
* NPC/AI personas  
* Support/bot assistants  
* Social team-based interactions

Think of Messaging as your **"Inbox / Chat" feature**.

### **Characteristics of Messages:**

* Personal  
* Usually requires or invites a response  
* Human-like or conversational  
* Threaded (conversation history)  
* Persistent

### **What goes into Messaging:**

## **A. Player-to-player messages**

* Friend messages  
* Trash-talk (if allowed)  
* Room invites from friends  
* Collaboration messages (“Join my team”, “Let’s compete together\!”)

## **B. NPC / AI Companion Messages (like Sarah Chen, Emma Wilson in your UI)**

* Feedback on trades  
* Motivational messages  
* Tips and insights  
* Story/lore contet  
* Personalized coaching

## **C. System-to-user conversational prompts**

* Welcome messages  
* Onboarding guidance  
* Tutorials  
* Interactive quests (“Complete your first trade to unlock…”)

## **D. Support / Help Desk / Bot Chat**

* “How can we help you?” type conversations  
* Report issues  
* Ask questions about the app

### **Examples from your screenshots that belong in MESSAGING:**

✔ Sarah Chen – “Great trade on NVDA\! How did you know?”  
 ✔ Emma Wilson – “Check out the AI recommendations…”  
 ✔ Mike Johnson – “Want to join my crypto room?”

These are **conversational, personal, and require replies** → therefore belong in the **Envelope**.

# **🔔 2\. Notifications (Bell Icon)**

### **Purpose:**

Deliver **short, one-way, real-time alerts** triggered by:

* System events  
* Trade actions  
* Achievements  
* Time-bound tasks  
* Market events  
* Room deadlines  
* Milestones

Notifications \= **status updates**, not conversations.

### **Characteristics of Notifications:**

* One-way  
* Information only  
* No response needed  
* Short, actionable  
* Disappear or auto-clear  
* Not threaded

### **What goes into Notifications:**

## **A. Trade Activity Alerts**

* “Bought AAPL @ $185.2”  
* “Sold TSLA (+$412.5)”

## **B. Room & Challenge Status**

* “Tech Giants Challenge ends in 24 hours”  
* “Leaderboard updated”

## **C. Achievements & Rewards**

* “First Win\! You finished 1st in Beginner Trading 101”  
* “Portfolio exceeded $50,000”

## **D. System Alerts**

* Maintenance notifications  
* New room available  
* Season end countdown

## **E. Market-based Alerts**

* Price spikes/drops  
* Earnings reports  
* Trading halts

### **Examples from your screenshots that belong in NOTIFICATIONS:**

✔ “Sold TSLA – \+$412.5”  
 ✔ “Bought AAPL – Total: $9,260”  
 ✔ “First Win\! Earned 500 stars”  
 ✔ “Portfolio exceeded $50,000”  
 ✔ “Tech Giants Challenge ends in 24 hours”

These are **pure alerts** → therefore belong in the **Bell**.

# **🔍 3\. Summary: Quick Decision Rules**

### **If it requires a reply → Messaging**

### **If it is personal or social → Messaging**

### **If it is instructional or conversational → Messaging**

---

### **If it informs, alerts, or notifies → Notifications**

### **If it is system-generated → Notifications**

### **If it’s tied to trades, performance, or market events → Notifications**

---

# **🧠 4\. Why This Separation Matters**

### **Better UX:**

Users instinctively know:

* Envelope \= “someone is talking to me”  
* Bell \= “system update”

### **Lower mental load:**

Conversations don’t get buried under performance alerts.

### **Higher engagement:**

NPC and player messages remain easy to find → drives social stickiness.

### **Clear game structure:**

Progression (wins, milestones) lives under Notifications → makes achievements feel system-authenticated.
